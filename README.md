# Collage diffusion demo

This repository contains an implementation of [Collage Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00262), an enhancement of Stable Diffusion that provides layer-based controls for compositional image generation. 

`CollageDiffusionDemo.ipynb` contains a Python notebook that you can [open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t80T6VgRg37ZfeaiLEhgK087malaVwh2?usp=sharing#scrollTo=CM99Cbv2NGg0) to get started. 

## Set-up
We provide a series of example collages to help you get started. To do so, navigate to the Google Drive links below:
* [Image layers](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EfoLfWbn5fl7c092uk96zHtJOVHRlIqI?usp=sharing)
* [Pre-computed textual inversion embeddings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Gg8y-0FxdPcuhrPOUw6Ze9wa0Ruu-cI?usp=sharing)

The default directory that the notebook expects these to be in is "Colab Notebooks" in your Google Drive, but this can be configured. If you want to use our default settings, go to the Google Drive link and click the down arrow next to `image_layers` or `asset_library` and click "Add shortcut to Drive". You can then choose "Colab Notebooks" and be good to go!
